uPSPD
=====

uPSPD (unofficial PSP documentation) was a project of making a full documentation for PSP.

**In an effort to avoid documentation fragmentation, the contents to the wiki have been moved to [the PSP dev wiki](https://playstationdev.wiki/pspdevwiki/index.php/Main_Page) and this repository shouldn't be used anymore.**

The old documentation remains in the "Wiki" tab of this page.

## Where can documentation be found?

We uploaded useful information to our Github repository: http://uofw.github.io/upspd/docs/
