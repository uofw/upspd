 below compiled from various sources, including: adrahil, Chilly Willy, 
FreePlay, harleyg, jas0nuk, l_oliveira, Mathieulh, Saben, SilverSpring, 
Squirrel, vb_master<br>
<br>
The following keys are backed up separately from the IdStorage, non-indexed: 4, 5, 6, F, 30-3F, 40-46, 50, 140<br>
<br>
NOTE: Slim v1 = TA-085 baryon 22B200, Slim v1.1 = TA-085 baryon 234000, Slim v2 = TA-088, Fat v4 = TA-086<br>
<br>
* = key is the same per model, but not necessarily the same in every PSP<br>
* = key is unique to each PSP<br>
* = key is partially unique (e.g. WLAN region are all similar but with a few bytes changed for different regions)<br>
<br>
General info on each key<br>
* 0x4 - Baryon settings/information - extra data added since Slim v1<br>
* 0x5 - Clockgen/I2C setup commands - invalidating the first four bytes 
enables 1.50 to boot on TA-082+ by preventing an IPL crash due to 
unsupported hardware<br>
* 0x6 - Battery, CPU frequency and general power settings - extra data added since Slim v1<br>
* 0x7 - Unknown usage (exists since Fat v4/Slim v1) - changed in Slim v2<br>
* 0x8 - Brightness hardware control (exists since Fat v4/Slim v1) - 
changed in Slim v1.1 and again in Slim v2 - if this is detected, the 
data in them is used to control the brightness levels. If not, the board
 acts as a TA-079 which causes brightness level issues with the new 
hardware.<br>
<br>
* 0x10 - MagicGate<br>
* 0x11 - MagicGate<br>
* 0x12 - MagicGate<br>
* 0x13 - MagicGate<br>
* 0x40 - Contains the 0x5 bytes at 0x88 from key 0x10<br>
All of the above are required for MagicGate to work<br>
<br>
* 0x41 - USB (Driver type identifier) - slightly different since Slim v1<br>
* 0x43 - USB (Device ID) - slightly different since Slim v1<br>
<br>
* 0x44 - WLAN MAC Address (can be rebuilt using Noobz MAC Address Fixer)<br>
* 0x45 - WLAN Region (can be rebuilt using KeyCleaner)<br>
<br>
* 0x47 - Default parental lock level (first byte is 0x09, rest is empty)<br>
<br>
* 0x50 - Serial number (not used since TA-082)<br>
* 0x51 - Firmware the PSP shipped with, and unknown unique data (exists since Fat v4/Slim v1)<br>
* 0x52 - Unused by PSP - Mostly the same per PSP except for slight 
variations - could be manufacturing info (exists since Slim v1)<br>
* 0x54 - Default XMB background colour - first 3 bytes: 02 00 02 in PSP-200X IS, 02 00 00 in PSP-200X PB (exists since Slim v1)<br>
<br>
* 0x100 - DNAS, VSH &amp; Internet browser region, ad-hoc region (if missing, official updaters cannot run - error CTA80000025)<br>
* 0x101 - OpenPSID (non-indexed duplicate at [location of original + 0x8000])<br>
<br>
* 0x102 - UMD (non-indexed duplicate at [location of original + 0x8000])<br>
* 0x103 - UMD (non-indexed duplicate at [location of original + 0x8000])<br>
* 0x104 - UMD (non-indexed duplicate at [location of original + 0x8000])<br>
* 0x105 - UMD (non-indexed duplicate at [location of original + 0x8000])<br>
* 0x106 - UMD (non-indexed duplicate at [location of original + 0x8000])<br>
102-106 is a continuous key which the UMD drive uses. Any invalid ones 
(missing, edited, or from another PSP) will prevent the UMD sectors 
being decrypted, resulting in a Disc Read Error<br>
<br>
* 0x120-0x126 - backup of respective 0x0100-106 key<br>
<br>
* 0x140 - Unknown unique data<br>
<br>
More info on keys 4-8<br>
Keys 4-8 are setup data for various devices. Their structure is as follows:typedef struct {<br>
        u32 signature;      // "Clkg", "Bryn", etc<br>
        int type;           // always 00000001 so far<br>
        int datalen;        // length of data starting at 0x10<br>
        u32 hash;           // hash of data from 0x10 to 0x10+datalen<br>
        u8 databuf[0x1F0];  // data used for hardware init/control<br>
} SceIdStorageLeaf;<br>
<br>
Since official updater 3.30, every updater has a hidden module called 
sceChkDegeneration which checks the signatures of these keys and 
produces an error if the signature is incorrect:<br>
<br>
DRNFFFFFFD8 = key 0x4 missing<br>
DRNFFFFFFD7 = key 0x4 header is not "n y r B" (in hex: 6E 79 72 42)<br>
DRNFFFFFFCE = key 0x5 missing<br>
DRNFFFFFFCD = key 0x5 header is not "g k l C" (in hex: 67 6B 6C 43)<br>
DRNFFFFFFC4 = key 0x6 missing<br>
DRNFFFFFFC3 = key 0x6 header is not "r d D M" (in hex: 72 64 44 4D)<br>
<br>
Additional checks in TA-086:<br>
DRNFFFFFFB9 = key 0x7 header is not "D a P A" (in hex: 44 61 50 41)<br>
DRNFFFFFFB0 = key 0x8 missing<br>
DRNFFFFFFAF = key 0x8 header is not "p D C L" (in hex: 70 44 43 4C) - 
for this error, creating a fake key 8 is not enough as this will result 
in the brightness not working at all, a real key must be used.<br>
<br>
KIRK commands<br>
IdStorage keys are created by one of the KIRK commands, so we need to 
get as much information as we can about KIRK (aka semaphore hardware 
decryption)<br>

<br>
The latter. The Pandora's an awesome great tool but it's been set up 
from scratch. Sony's magic stick is different and probably includes the 
code to regenerate IDStorage. But as long as there's no complete dump of
 it but just the crippled ones floating around the net, chances are few 
of reversing it. So the other option is solid research and that's what 
Jas0nuk is proposing.</div></div><hr>

 is a special part of the firmware NOT in the normal flash areas. It's 
composed of "leafs" that contain 512 bytes of data. There can be at most
 65520 of these leafs (also called keys by most folks), but Sony only 
uses about 128 of them currently. They hold various bits of info used by

No IdStorage means loss of many functions related to WIFI, USB, and PS3

 existing keys have new content. So rebuilding the IdStorage will 
require knowledge about the mobo. Probably at first, the person will 
have to manually choose the mobo from a list.<br>

Yeah, and it's called Kirk. My strong believe is that all IDS keys for a
 certain type of motherboard are identical with exception of things like
 MAC and serial, but it's encryption or signing that makes them not work
 on another PSP.<br>
<br>
Even then, some info cannot be found except by opening the PSP. The WIFI MAC address in key 0x44 is that way.<br>
<br>
Don't agree, you can also use a wifi router to find the MAC without 
opening the PSP. The serial is written in the battery bay if some 
a**hole didn't remove the label (I've seen LOADS of PSP's that for some 
reason had the label removed, probably because the user expected tons of
 screws underneath it).<br>
<br>
But even more, I think everything can be retrieved from the PSP itself 
by software, including MAC and serial (the serial must be stored in Kirk
 in order to create unique encryption keys). I bet it's only readable in
 factory mode, though.<br>
<br>
BTW. Jas0nuk, wouldn't it be wise to move all this "what is IDStorage 
for" discussions to another thread (maybe the general IDStorage thread)?
 This thread is only one day old and it's already clogged with posts 
that do not add anything to the initial discussion.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Just to clear some things up, max number of leaf's is only 480 (all that
 can fit on the nand - without doing some voodoo repartitioning stuffs).
 Idstorage area is only 256KB (ie. 512pages==16Blocks). Each leaf takes 
up 1 page (512Bytes), so then why cant you fit 512 leaf's in, because 
each leaf is mapped to a keyID (0x0044 for example) and these ID's are 
stored in an index. 2 pages are allocated to the index, so really that 
only leaves 510 pages left for the leaf's. However, due to another 
restriction, the index pages can only be stored at the start of a block 
(ie. the first 2 pages of a block). So really you only have 15Blocks 
left for actual leaf data (32pages per block and you end up having only 
480 pages, hence only 480 maxium leafs).<br>
<br>
The leaf's keyID however can be represented by any 16bit digit (from 
0x0001-0xFFEF), you can choose to have whatever you wish in that range.</div></div><hr>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chilly Willy</div><div class="date">08-25-2007, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Squirrel,
 I checked my battery bay and there's no MAC address there. If anyone 
removed a sticker, it was at Sony because I'm the only one to use this 
PSP, and I removed it from the box when I bought it. Maybe it was 
something they started recently. Mine is a TA-082 bought from WalMart 
about a year ago.<br>
<br>
Also, wouldn't a WIFI router need the PSP to be actively doing WIFI to 
get the MAC address? We're talking about rebuilding the keys from a dead
 PSP, right? If a PSP is working well enough to do WIFI, it's not in the
 condition the thread is trying to find the cure for.<br>
<br>
So we come back to either opening the PSP (if not recorded in the 
battery bay), or hoping it's recorded in some bit of the hardware in the
 PSP accessible to something run from Pandora.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MajorGrubert</div><div class="date">08-25-2007, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Squirrel,
 I can confirm what Chilly Willy noticed. I have a US (PSP1001) TA-082 
bought at a Sony store and it never had a sticker with the MAC address 
in the battery bay. There is a serial number in the sticker, but it does
 not seem to be related to the MAC address.<br>
<br>
@Chilly Willy, I understand your concern about the need of a working 
wi-fi connection to be able to get the MAC address from a router, but I 
wonder if a PSP trying to set an ad-hoc link would broadcast some 
packets anyway. Those packets could be captured with a wi-fi sniffer 
like Kismet (http://www.kismetwireless.net). I guess we need a PSP with a
 corrupted key 0x0044 to test this.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">l_oliveira</div><div class="date">08-25-2007, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The
 MAC address obviously is readable through the data port connection from
 the PSP to the module. The PSP kernel has to compare what is on it's ID
 Storage to an answer from the module before it shows a error message. 
Obviously this "command" would be used by the official restore software 
to rebuild the mac address key.<br>
<br>
If you can dismantle your PSP, the sticker with the MAC is on the top of
 the WIFI module (TA-079/TA-081/TA-086) or at the memory stick board 
(TA-082).<br>
<br>
An connection test will also show the mac at the PSP screen, again proving it's readable through the I/O port.<br>
<br>
I suspect the WiFi module has a basic firmware built in but with feature
 that would allow firmware update upload and this update is contained in
 the file wlanfirm_magpie.prx <br>
<br>
Can anyone confirm this ?</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chilly Willy</div><div class="date">08-25-2007, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By
 the way, if we wish to run our own app under Pandora, do we make a PBP 
and use it in place of the update.pbp, or do we replace one of the elf 
files in the kd folder? I know the readme file says that it's not a FULL
 1.50 kernel so some apps won't work correctly, so that implies we can 
run our own apps. I was thinking of making a version of IDSM for Pandora
 so I could experiment on the IdStorage at that level.</div></div><hr>

<br>
You may be wrong. As harleyg has mentioned in the IdStorage thread 
(http://lan.sh/showpost.php?p=697&amp;postcount=26), it looks like the 
vsh only reads the MAC address stored at key 0x44, not the real hardware
 address. That's why his MAC address changer did not work. This doesn't 
mean, however, that the real address is not accessible at all.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Read again what I wrote. I said the kernel can compare the REAL mac 
address on the wi fi module and the ID storage key without even have to 
start negotiation of a ADHOC connection with another PSP !<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
The behavior of the AHDOC function with mismatched mad address on ID 
storage is show a kernel error message as soon the kernel access the wi 
fi module. It doesn't need to connect the wi fi to anything to just 
figure the real hardware MAC. So with this behavior analyzed we might be
 able to figure out a proper way to get the mac from the wi fi module 
without need the manual labor of inserting it ourselves.<br>
<br>
And when you do a infrastructure network test on FW 3.25 it shows the 
real hard mac at the PSP screen regardless what is on the ID storage 
key. I fixed a PSP that way and I didn't even had to bother with looking
 at the wifi router administration page to get logs of the mac address. 
 It just worked when I changed the mac to what I saw on the PSP screen.</div></div><hr>

Maybe I wasn't clear enough, maybe you didn't read well, but what I 
meant is that the battery bay usually contains a label with the PSP's 
serial. The label with the MAC address can only be found on the Wifi/MS 
board.<br>
<br>
To retrieve the MAC address without opening the PSP (thanks for the tip on 3.52 l_oliveira!) through a router:<br>
Establish a connection with a router. You can use WEP or WPA but no MAC filter since you don't know the correct MAC :).<br>
Proceed to the screen after the connection test, but don't finish the 
setup to keep the connection alive. Now enter your router's setup page 
throug a PC and check the logfile (every router has it). The last 
registered MAC on a wifi connection is that of the PSP. You can use MAC 
address changer v2 to rewrite it to the PSP.<br>
I've corrected MAC addresses countless times using this method but I guess I will be using l_oliveira's method in the future ;)<br>
<br>
BTW. The MAC address only affects ad-hoc connections. Even with a fooked
 MAC address (like those people who think it's cool to have DE:AD:BE:EF 
as MAC address), it's still possible to establish a connection to a 
router.</div></div><hr>

Fully restoring a ID storage would then be regenerate the fixed value 
keys, the non encrypted unique keys (especially MAC address) and finally
 performing the 10-13/100-106/120-126 keys restoration, but the 
challenge is fully automate the process, I guess.  Recover the MAC 
automatically is interesting and I bet the Sony official recovery 
software does that together with regeneration of the UMD/Region keys.</div></div><hr>

It did on older firmwares, but it seems Sony's changed that. I guess the

was playing the UMD game SIMS2 when i decided to turn it off without

not working anymore there is no red light so i swapped my spare UMD

light coming from the lens and to my surprise there was nothing.I was 
using a Fully working UMD drive not 1 but 2.So i decided to Flash it 
again using devo to 1.5 version then the UMD drive works again.So i 
decided to upgrade to 3.40OEA and walla the umd drive does not work 
again then i upgraded it to 3.51m33-2 and the UMD drive is working 
again.Its not the UMD drive thats faulty I have 3 fully working UMD 
Drives but all of them show the the same problem.If the problem is on my
 IDStorage then It automatically fix itself when i flash my psp.Ive read
 here that some keys have some back-up.What im suggesting is dumb i

After speaking a lot with l_oliveira and Matheiulh, it's time we 
investigated the commands which are used to verify the key. Here is a 
complete reversal of memlmd.prx from 1.50 which contains all the 
semaphore commands and how they interface with KIRK (the decryption 
engine), plus a reversal of the GetPsCode functions from sceChkreg (used
 to verify key 0x100)<br>
<br>
Semaphore command 0x12 is used to verify IdStorage keys<br>
Commands 0x11 to 0x17 are not documented, commands later than 17 are not implemented.<br>
The likelihood is that 0x11 is the command used to produce IdStorage keys.<br>

Trust me ...  If the NAND receive a page clear command and in the midle

erased. What you think would happen if one of the pages with the boot

<br>
Every time you change a setting or the PSP itself decides it's time to write on the NAND there's a chance for that to happen. <br>

I think that possibility brings a satisfactory explanation for random bricks on PSPs which are crashing often.<br>

 This thread had enlightened me quite a bit about why my original PSP 
(have 2 because I bricked my first one early on) shows a different MAC 
address than it really is. First, I confirmed that doing an 
infrastructure test DOES show the correct MAC address... oh backing up a
 bit I fixed it by replacing the motherboard so naturally what is in the
 NAND wouldn't match my actual wireless card.<br>
<br>
This PSP, howerver hasn't had 1 single problem since with multiplayer, 
internet, running updates, or anything for that matter. In light of 
this, I don't think there is a need to pay attention to this key as much
 as it seems some of you are because if it was required as a part of 
these kirk checks or whatever, my PSP would be screwed simply because I 
changed the motherboard.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel</div><div class="date">08-28-2007, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Urherenow,
 since you replaced the complete motherboard, your PSP has a working 
motherboard with the complete IDStorage that matches it (since it was 
factory-installed for that motherboard). IDStorage is stored on the 
motherboard, not somewhere else in the PSP.<br>
<br>
The only thing you did when you replaced the motherboard, is use a 
different MAC in software than your wifi actually has. As you've 
experienced, this isn't causing problems for everything that you can use
 a router or accesspoint for. However, ad-hoc gaming will be impossible.
 For that reason, it's recommended to everyone who replaces his 
motherboard or the wificard, to read the wificard's actual MAC and 
reprogram that to the motherboard.<br>
<br>
Since you have two PSP's, you can easily test it by trying to connect them in a game in ad-hoc mode.<br>
<br>
But since the MAC key is not part of the "protected" keys, it's already 
been covered by MAC address changer v2 and no additional investigations 
are necessary on this key. However, it might be interesting to find out 
if the real MAC can be read by software, directly from the hardware, for
 automated IDStorage rebuilding.</div></div><hr>

There are several possibilities:<br>
- The motherboard ID is stored somewhere in hardware. Would be the best 
for regenerating IDStorage, but I wonder if it really is present.<br>
- The serial is stored somewhere in hardware. I think it is, because the
 serial is included in IDStorage and Sony should want an automated 
IDStorage generation without manual intervention (typing in the serial 
number). Although it's still possible that the serials are generated 
automatically and after flashing, a corresponding label is put on the 
PSP. However, the serial ranges could possibly be used to determine the

There are multiple ways to determine the motherboard type, usually by

motherboard versions eg. wlan, vme, nand etc. etc. (this is the way SCE

Just to make things clear: SHA-1 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) is
 not an encryption algorithm, it is a hashing algorithm. AES 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) is a block 
cipher  encryption algorithm.<br>
<br>
AES is used to encrypt/decrypt a block of data using a key know to both 
parties. Suppose you have some data (say, a block of 512 bytes). You 
select a cryptographic key and encode your data using AES. You end up 
with another 512 bytes of encrypted content that can only be decrypted 
using the original cryptographic key. If Sony encodes something using 
AES, the PSP must have a copy of the key somewhere, even if it is buried
 inside some piece of hardware used only for cryptography and can't be 
retrieved.<br>
<br>
SHA-1 is used to calculate a fixed-length hash code, known as a message 
digest, of a given data block. The digest is always 20 bytes (160 bits) 
long. SHA-1 cannot be used for encryption, its main use is to digitally 
sign data in order to prevent further tampering, together with 
private/public key algorithms such as RSA. <br>
<br>
Hope this help to clarify things.</div></div><hr>

 don't get it. How do I know which sections equal a 'key' by looking at a
 nand dump? I can clearly see data starting at 0x000C6000 but it looks 
like I have nothing at 0x000DA000. a bit below that, at: <br>
da3c4-da3cf, <br>
da5d4-da5df, <br>
da7e4-dafef, and <br>
da9f4-da9ff<br>
<br>
I have FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF 00F0 FFFF<br>
<br>
written with a bunch of zeros before and in between, and nothing but fffffff aftwerwards... what's this for?<br>
<br>
Ok... I found my serial number down at 0x000CE610  but it's listed here as 'key 0x50' this is what's confusing me.<br>
also the code for my serial:<br>
3446 4D35 3031 3434 3439 3457 3131 3036     serial: 4FM50144494W110648830211150118<br>
3438 3833 3032 3131 3135 3031 3138 0104<br>
0001 0001 0101 0101 0101 0101 0100 0000<br>
<br>
Of course the serial will be different, but why do you suppose mine has a
 0104 where Harleyg has 0103... even though that's after the text 
portion of the serial? I'm pretty darn sure I'm using a ta-79<br>
<br>
Another confusing thing is the region codes listed here... I did a 
search for USA (and the others) and none of those codes are on my nand 
dump! Plz explain :( nevermind again... harleyg added an extra 00 01 too
 all of his region codes :P</div></div><hr>

 "key" or leaf like sony calls them is a cellar of 0x200 bytes then 
there's a spare of 0x0F bytes which is from the NAND itself, the PSP 
uses the spares for indexing and bad block marking.<br>
<br>
the last blocks of the IDStorage contains a sort of "FAT table" which we
 just refer to as "Index table" then a huge blank area follows until 
where the LFLASH <br>
(partitions area) starts.</div></div><hr>

<br>
I was under the impression that the PSP settings were stored on a CMOS 
RAM chip, and the data was kept on it with a small cell battery. Isn't 
that why if the PSP battery is kept uncharged for long enough that you 
lose all your settings and need to re-enter them at boot?</div></div><hr>

 think only RTC is kept via that battery, when that is lost it prompts 
you to enter the settings. Most psp setting/userdata is kept in flash1 
registry dat files though.</div></div><hr>

 still don't get the key/leaf thing and the 512bytes... where does this 
information come from? The UMD data CLEARLY takes up a whole lot more 
than 512 bytes. And my uneducated guess is that it takes 3,232 bytes. I 
think this because the region code information is there 5 TIMES (with a 
heck of  a lot more than 512 bytes in between) and I kept following it 
until it was just fffff... because everything from 000c6000-000c6ca0 
(3,232 bytes) is repeated byte for byte at 000d6800-000d74a0. It's like 
this on both of my PSPs. <br>
<br>
I was foolishly hoping that I could copy that whole block of data from a
 different region but now know it's not true because most of the code 
there is very different between my PSPs. I haven't completed a byte for 
byte comparison yet but so far I've found many short bits of code 
repeated and many 28byte and 8byte segments that match exactly on both 
PSPs<br>
<br>
can somebody tell me the significance of the code from c64d0 to c676f? 
It's scary how close that section is between my PSP's except for a few 
distinct 4 byte segments here and there. This wouldn't be an embedded 
key?</div></div><hr>

Are you sure ALL the keys were replaced? This is interesting, unless you
 were using M33 which nulls out the KIRK checking of firmware PRXs and 
IdStorage keys.</div></div><hr>

 had a similar experience some time ago: I unbricked (classic method) a 
motherboard straight to M33-4 and decided to do some tests before 
restoring the IDStorage from the bricked nand. Since I had to return the
 board, I couldn't do much testing, but I managed to start a Sony 
downloadable program (the Go Cam soft) with no errors. Since there's 
currently no newer update available than 3.52, I couldn't test update 
capability nor UMD's (the board came without PSP ;) ). Later tests by 
Covert have proven that most things don't work so installing M33 is not a
 universal solution for PSP's where IDStorage has been damaged.</div></div><hr>

I used one of Chilly Willy's apps (forgot which one). I think his app

IdStorage Manager will overwrite all keys in the folder. KeyCleaner only
 messes with the few keys associated with the old downgraders.</div></div><hr>

0x120-13f, but what I found was something different.  I found 
triplicates  for all but 1 of these keys (0x100-&gt;0x120), and 
duplicates for many more.  These extra hits are intermixed with the 
keyed data, but have no index entries.  These may be a source for 
getting the "as-shipped" values.  I need to do some more testing to see

Many keys have a checksum of bf619eac0cdf3f68d496ea9344137e8b, and 
contain nothing but zeroes. For the full list, including these keys, 
check the attachment.<br>
<br>
Thanks vb_master for your help, and Chilly Willy for IdStorage Manager which was luckily HEN compatible.</div></div><hr>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chilly Willy</div><div class="date">09-11-2007, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you downgrade a TA-082 PSP using the Pandora Battery do you need to use the key cleaner to fix the brightness problem?<br>
<br>
No, the Pandora downgrader is corruption-free. If you have a brightness 
problem after downgrading with it, you have a PSP with the newer LCD and
 the problem is due to the display libs and the LCD module, not the 
keys.<br>
<br>
By the way, I installed 3.60 M33 on my Silver Slim and my latest 
KeyCleaner and IDStorage Manager apps run on it fine. Dumping the keys 
works fine, and an examination shows that the keys aren't encrypted at 
the library level. Using IDSM to look at the keys (or looking at the 
dumped keys) shows that the keys are mostly like the previous models 
with a few changes in keys like 4, 5, 6, etc. I rather expected them to 
make minor changes. I'll be releasing an update to KeyCleaner this 
coming weekend that properly identifies the keys for the Slim so that 
idiots don't think their Slim has bad keys because they examined it as a
 TA-082/86.</div></div><hr>

The PSP's are identical except for the color so this should make a good comparison to determine which keys are PSP-dependant.<br>
Chilly Willy, if you're interested in the keys contents, please let me know.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chilly Willy</div><div class="date">09-12-2007, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at your checksums, you see that the following are different:<br>
7,8,10,11,13,40,44,__,__,51,52,54,100-106,120-126,140<br>
<br>
While between your IS and mine is:<br>
7,8,10,11,13,40,44,45,50,51,52,__,100-106,120-126,140<br>

What we see is (seemingly) 45 related to the region of the PSP (as we 
knew before), 50 seems to be region related as well, while 54 seems 
model related (both ISs the same, but the IS and PB different).</div></div><hr>

 think we have enough Slim IdStorage dumps for the current revision. We 
can conclude that there are no new keys apart from 0x52 and 0x54.<br>
As for the IdStorage keys common to both models, we need to find out what the purposes of 0x7, 0x47 and 0x140 are.</div></div><hr>

Every PSP has unique 10-13, 40, 100-106 (and mirrored 120-126) keys.<br>
When I flashed someone else's TA-082 keys to my TA-082, the UMD still 
worked (102-106). And the only thing not working was game saves for 
certain games like Socom FTB2.<br>
That's why I thought that.<br>
Are you sure ALL the keys were replaced? This is interesting, unless you
 were using M33 which nulls out the KIRK checking of firmware PRXs and 
IdStorage keys.<br>
<br>
Probably showing my ignorance here, but if M33 nulls out KIRK checking, 
why doesn't my UMD read when I flash M33? It's a TA-082 bought as a

 showing my ignorance here, but if M33 nulls out KIRK checking, why 
doesn't my UMD read when I flash M33? It's a TA-082 bought as a brick 
that I recovered with Pandora. Does that mean that idstorage isn't my 
problem?<br>
<br>
You're putting things upside down. If your UMD doesn't read, IDStorage 
is your problem. I guess you did a full flash including IDStorage 
because "M33 nulls out KIRK checking" but if you read well, it's been 
reported repeatedly that it's still impossible to use another PSP's 
IDStorage, even on M33. Maybe they didn't null the KIRK checking fully 
or maybe it's the signing that's still present on the IDStorage keys.<br>
<br>
If you didn't make (and save) a dump of the bricked nand before flashing
 it, you're screwed. That is, you can still use the PSP for homebrew 
only.</div></div><hr>

Why did you use the MAC fixer? Did you replace your wifi card or your motherboard, or did the MAC just "magically" disappear?<br>
<br>
If the MAC disappeared or corrupted without doing anything to the 
hardware, it well could be your IDStorage has been screwed. Are you 
using 3.71 M33 firmware and did you use the USB flash0/1/2/3 access to 
write something to your flash? Is your PSP a fat or a slim?</div></div><hr>

In the past, I used to have an Amiga computer. It might have been the 
first computer to use a real GPU (although I'm not completely sure about
 this because I didn't research it). The GPU had to be programmed in a 
special language and could only be used for graphic effects. Even then, 
people managed to program it to aid the main processor in heavy 
calculations. So as long as a GPU is programmable, it can be used for 
user programs.<br>
<br>
But for Jachra's remark, Elcomsoft currently can only use GPU processors
 which are capable of integer arithmetic. Most GPUs are designed for 
floating point arithmetic and only a few are capable of integer 
arithmetic.<br>
<br>
Still, it's an interesting development. We all know the PSP's GPU is pretty powerful for such a small unit.</div></div><hr>

You're thinking of two separate parts of the custom chips: the COPPER 
and the BLITTER. The COPPER was the coprocessor and did VERY simple 
instructions - move data to a custom chip register, skip based on beam 
position, and wait for beam position. Using those few commands, you 
could control what happened in the custom chips based on the screen 
position. This was mostly used for changing colors on the fly, or 
sprites on the fly, but you could do more with some thought.<br>
<br>
The BLITTER was a fairly decent bitblk engine, capable of blitting data 
with logical operations between the two sources and destination, drawing
 lines, and filling between drawn lines. Using the logic of the blitter,
 you could do things like convert chunky pixel data into planar data.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Yeah, I lost the details in time. The Copper couldn't be used for any 
kind of calculations, but I remember some programmers used the Blitter's
 functions for maths that the standard 68000 without FPU couldn't do 
fast enough. However, "programming language" is not exactly the way to 
describe how the Blitter had to be programmed. If I remember well, on a 
hardware level it was a matter of moving some data (start, end, 
destination, required operation) to special registers and with the last 
write the whole process started. I don't know how modern GPU's are 
working, but on a hardware level it still could be not too much 
different ;)</div></div><hr>

Under normal conditions you are right, but maybe with the use of the GPU
 we could speed things. Also since there isn't any program available 
yet, we could create it and let people just try it. I do not how many 
outputs of the ID Storage keys have been compared. Maybe we do not have 
to calculate all the bytes.<br>
<br>
A little hope is in my honest opinion better than no hope.</div></div><hr>

 cory if we are able to nail a perfect GPU code execution via microcode 
it's fairly fast to achive a 512bit decrypter r code breaker, but the 
big hassle here is getting to know all of the Gpu microcodes to begin 
with. the EE on the Ps2 has been known to be very code worthy when it 
comes to helping the Mips cpu out ( i remember Shadow of colossus using 
this technique). using squirrels technique of bit flushing or blitting 
will work too but it's likely we would be limited to the ram available 
to the GPU since flushing data back and forth will eat bandwidth.<br>
<br>
modern GPU's work by taking commands:<br>
screen size<br>
buffer params<br>
3d vertex datas<br>
high order priority bit (which things need to be calculated first)<br>
raster or 3d data bits for physical or virtual calculations<br>
and a whole lot of other stuff.<br>
<br>
the bright side of things are GFX cards are in the 256bit + modes not 
like our cpu's which are just frailing the 64bit range. with this power 
all we need is the proper codes to activate it. since microcodes are the
 fasted possible executable code existant to cpu's it's out best bet to 
bruteforce the passwords. but like i said microcodes are tough to handle
 since you need to be very familiar with the architecture in order to 
work with it.</div></div><hr>

Yes they can. Why not, if you're the company that invented the whole 
thing including the encryption used? It is well known that Sony uses a 
magic memory stick to unbrick PSP's, that's somewhat comparable with the
 Pandora stick, but which also regenerates IDStorage.</div></div><hr>

KeyCleaner doesn't (yet) fix 0x41 when it is bad all by itself. The way 
to fix it is to run IdStorage Manager and dump the keys. Then replace 
the 0x0041.bin file with a good copy (key 0x41 is universal on phat 
psps, so any good 0x41 would work). Then run IDSM again and select 
verify/fix keys. IDSM will see that 0x0041.bin doesn't match the key in 
the idstorage and will ask if you wish to overwrite the key with the

I have a TA-082 mobo, and I had problems with the brightness bug. (In other words my TA-082 mobo acts like a TA-086)<br>
<br>
Using IDSM I popped in key8 into my PSP, and the symptom that appear are simply.... gone.<br>

Through email Chilly Willy said that the LCD modules of later 82 boards are same as 86 motherboards. <br>

There seem to be two revisions of the TA-082 board. The second one with 
the new brightness hardware one was first labelled the TA-082, and later
 labelled the TA-086. This can be proven by the fact that the TA-082 and
 TA-082 rev2/TA-086 both have the same Tachyon (VME) hardware version

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toto12345</div><div class="date">12-03-2007, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks,<br>
<br>
I've been reading this forum for a while, and thinking about idStorage 
issues. I took the time to register an account, in case the following 
will be helpful for you guys to figure out idStorage regeneration.<br>
<br>
We know that:<br>
<br>
* idStorage stores keys required to properly verify/decrypt UMD and MagicGate content<br>
* those keys are unique per PSP<br>
<br>
I suspect that:<br>
<br>
* there is a set of "master keys" that SCE has and uses to encrypt/sign UMD / MagicGate stuff. <br>
* because an UMD must be read everywhere, this set of keys is most certainly unique.<br>
* SCE doesn't want to embed these keys directly into the flash of their devices, as it would be far too easy to recover them.<br>
<br>
Hence, we might deduce that:<br>
<br>
* actual encryption/decryption of UMD/MG content is done in hardware, 
not by the MIPS. isn't there a specific DRM chip on the PSP mobo?<br>
* the idStorage keys are themselves encrypted with a per-device key. 
this per-device key is used to decrypt idStorage into the master keys<br>
<br>
Well, knowing this, the regeneration of idStorage would require:<br>
<br>
* the knowledge of the master keys, and the per-device key. SCE has the 
master keys, and there could be a specific "magic command" to retrieve 
or modify the per-device key<br>
<br>
This DRM could be cracked, not that easily though. A possible way of 
attack is to reverse-engineer the DRM chip, from there you could recover
 the master keys, and also find out the "magic command" to 
retrieve/reset the per-device key.<br>
<br>
This is also another alternative: perhaps, to reduce costs, there is no 
per-device key. Then, the master key is already embedded in the DRM 
chip, and the idStorage UMD/MG blob is actually not a set of encrypted 
keys, but rather a keyed MAC (for example, HMAC-MD5 or whatever) of a 
specific part of the PSP, like the serial number. The DRM chip knows the
 MAC key and the serial number, and checks if the calculated MAC matches
 the idStorage MAC. If not, it turns down itself.<br>
<br>
However, this would mean there is not a per-device key, but rather a 
common "MAC key" to authentify the idStorage. Someone in this thread 
mentioned the possibility of brute-forcing it -- just not possible if 
SCE did their homework on message authentication codes.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, just my 2c. If there are mistakes above, feel free to correct me :)</div></div><hr>

<br>
<br>
I don't think we need the per-device key. For a simple reason...<br>
The "Syscon" chip obviously has some kind of service mode which is used 
to create the ID storage. If it does work this way, then it would maybe 
require a "master key" and then receive a set of static data to be 
encrypted internally by the device using it's per-device key.<br>
 <br>
The resulting data would work only for the device that encrypted it, on 
our case, the PSP that generated it. The result is achieved without the 
need of the internal device key be ever needed by anyone else than it's 
own internal encryption engine.<br>
<br>
An pretty decent test would be taking two boards of the same kind and 
swapping the contents of their nands RAW, then using proper BGA 
soldering equipment swap the "Syscon" chips.<br>
<br>
Did anyone ever consider logic probing the bus that goes from the CPU to the "Syscon" ?</div></div><hr>

Only if the mechanism to recreate the idstorage keys still exist in 
syscon (currently the prime suspect of where this "unique id key" is 
stored). Though it's still no trivial task to extract the id if that 
mechanism no longer exists.<br>
<br>
And yea, that is (currently) the only way to make a nand dump from a 
another psp work, though you still need bga equipment to do it. But 
essentially that is no different to doing a full mobo swap with the psp 
that the nand dump came from.<br>
<br>
toto12345:<br>
<br>
Yes decryption of umd's are done via hardware, there is a dedicated 
crypto device to do that. Essentially what happens is: (NOTE: not 
totally confirmed yet but all evidence so far suggests it to be the 
case)<br>
<br>
* the UMD has 2048 Byte sectors with a 16 Byte "spare" area per sector.<br>
* the spare area holds a key to decrypt that sector<br>
* that key is encrypted<br>
* the keys to decrypt that key are in idstorage<br>
* those keys are also encrypted<br>
* the key to decrypt those keys is the unique per psp id<br>
* which again leads us right back to syscon...<br>
<br>
SCE does use keyed MAC elsewhere though, the 2.60+ IPL encryption uses a
 standard HMAC-SHA256 algo (with part of the preipl as secret key). So 
they have done their homework to prevent bruteforce attacks. Though 
unfortunately for them it was an exploit in the preipl code that lead it
 to be dumped (rather than an attack on the crypto) making their "secret
 key" not so secret anymore and hence their crypto completely useless 
:p. <br>
<br>
I'll be writing up tech doc for that too (since it is by far the most 
paranoid attempt from SCE for any of their security to date). <br>
A quick summary:<br>
<br>
- Preipl buffer used as secret key<br>
- Various global buffers are also used for the secret key for each 
HMAC-SHA256 generated along the way (I've ommited those in the 
following)<br>
<br>
Initialise the seed:<br>
- Seed a MT19937 pseudo random number generator with address of the preipl buffer<br>
- Grab 4KB from the prng<br>
- Merge it with the preipl buffer<br>
- Generate HMAC-SHA256 of the new buffer<br>
- Xor MAC with a global buffer<br>
- That is now your seed to use to decrypt an encrypted buffer<br>
<br>
To decrypt:<br>
- Gen HMAC-SHA256 of the seed from above<br>
- Repeatedly fill the MT19937 state with this MAC<br>
- For each 32-bytes of ciphertext:<br>
- Grab 64-bytes from the prng<br>
- Gen HMAC-SHA256 of those 64-bytes<br>
- Xor the ciphertext with that MAC to get the final plaintext</div></div><hr>

I've stumped up some theories now, I'm sorry if they're completly wrong :p<br>
So you need 2 keys to decrypt the UMD data:<br>
<br>
Key #1 = Get this key from the IDStorage, then decrypt it with a PSP-unique key<br>
Key #2 = The key from the UMD spare sector, which is still encrypted and needs to be decrypted with key #1<br>
<br>
If I understand correct, key 1 is always the same in the end, it gets 
different values on every PSP at first, but then always ends up with the
 same key after decrypting it.<br>
Now, what if you would create a memory dump of the decrypted key 1, then
 save it elsewhere. That'll give you a PSP-independent decryption key, 
right?<br>
Next thing, would it be possible to hook the sce functions that execute 
the whole key 1 decryption process, and instead just force it to take 
the already independent key that we dumped on a working PSP?</div></div><hr>

Indeed, this is what we've always suspected. Just like with sigchecking, the final data is probably the same on all PSPs :)</div></div><hr>

Knowing Sony, the unique ID will be somewhere called 'Picard' or something... :D<br>

<br>
No, dont know the codename for syscon.<br>
<br>
Spock is the other crypto engine (as opposed to Kirk :p). Both have 
access to the psp's unique id. Both are similar in many ways, they both 
have roughly the same number of cmds, have similar registers, but Spock 
is many many times more complex to interface with.<br>
<br>
Kirk HW registers are mapped to 0xBDE000xx while Spock HW registers are mapped to 0xBDF000xx.<br>
<br>
The Signature &amp; Version registers:<br>
<br>
0xBDE00000: 'K' 'I' 'R' 'K'<br>
0xBDE00004: '0' '0' '1' '0'<br>
<br>
0xBDF00000: 'S' 'P' 'O' 'K'<br>
0xBDF00004: '0' '0' '5' '0'<br>
<br>
These were from my psp (a TA-079) so the versions might be different on your psp.<br>
<br>
(Note: this will all be in the tech doc, plus the rest of the registers and how to use)<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
Before I posted a sample of how to interface with the Kirk registers, it
 currently decrypts IPL but can be modded to decrypt prx's as well.<br>
<br>
http://silverspring.lan.st/IPL Decrypt Sample.rar<br>
<br>
The interface with the Spock registers will be similar but a lot more complex.</div></div><hr>

About lowio.prx, it was just an attempt from sce to save some flash 
space. They implemented a few things starting from 3.50 to save space:<br>
<br>
 - changed the prx format by stripping some data from it (saving upto a few KB per prx in some cases)<br>
 - started using RLZ compression for a few of the larger prx's (saving over 150KB in the case of libssl.prx)<br>
- packing multiple prxs together into a single prx to save on slack 
space due to the use of 16KB cluster sizes of the FAT12 filesystem that 
they use for flash0.<br>
<br>
That was the case with lowio.prx, it grouped together the low level io drivers:<br>
<br>
 - sysreg.prx (7KB)<br>
 - gpio.prx (4KB)<br>
 - pwm.prx (2KB)<br>
 - i2c.prx (5KB)<br>
 - dmacplus.prx (9KB)<br>
 - lcdc.prx (5KB)<br>
 - emc_sm.prx (3KB)<br>
 - emc_ddr.prx (9KB)<br>
<br>
Note: sizes are of pre-3.50 fw (ie. 3.40).<br>
<br>
Since each prx is less than 16KB, each wastes quite a bit on slack and 
all individually stored on a 16KB cluster FAT12 partition would take up 
8*16KB = 128KB.<br>
<br>
From 3.50 stored all in one prx, lowio.prx is 30KB so would take up 32KB on a FAT12 partition, saving 96KB of flash space.<br>
<br>
In future firmware, more &amp; more prxs will probably be grouped 
together like this to save even more space, especially with small prx's 
that are only few KB in size (each of which would take up 16KB on the 
partition).</div></div><hr>

Yes, you can use these keys from another TA-086. Just get the keys and use KeyCleaner to flash them.</div></div><hr>

KeyCleaner won't do that. If the keys are missing, you need to run 
IdStorage Manager, create the keys (they will be created as clear keys),
 make a dump of the keys, replace the specific dumped keys with the good
 keys, then do verify/fix in IdStorage Manager.</div></div><hr>

Once key 0x100 is changed, you can't run official updaters. You should,

Rather, they probably use the MS's serial as a seed. If MS IPL booting

You're contradicting yourself :p This is the REASON why they used the MS
 serial: they used the same memory stick on different PSPs, this allowed
 them to strongly encrypt it and make it useless for other memory 
sticks, whilst allowing it to be used on any PSP (no worrying about the 
KIRK ID messing it up). Remeber the memory stick serial is stored on the
 memory stick, so whatever PSP they used it on, the serial would be the 
same. <br>
<br>
Also, SPOCK is probably only used for UMD decryption. I find it unlikely
 that they wouldn't use KIRK, as it's used to decrypt all other files.</div></div><hr>

As far as I know, there's no reason why, should we get a copy of Sony's Service IPL, we can't decrypt it.<br>
<br>
You think a different crypt engine is being used just because we don't have a decrypted version in front of us?</div></div><hr>

 agree with brin_vg that we should look into those files. There are 5 
PRX's that are not part of a normal firmware. They could hold some 
information for us.<br>
<br>
brin_vg, that was my thought.<br>
<br>
When I look in those PRX's I see something reoccurring. I do not know at
 this point if it is related to the encryption. The bytes at 0x00000000 
to 0x00000004 are empty aka has the byte filled with the value 0x00.  
The firmware PRX's have in that spot the "string "~PSP". That part seems
 to be removed for a purpose. Maybe to show that it is a different 
encryption method.<br>
<br>
The first block of bytes always end at 0x000000B4 with the value of 
0x80. The value for each byte from 0x00000005 to 0x000000B3 is not the 
same in every PRX.<br>
From 0x000000B5 to 0x000000CF it is always filled with value 0x00 for 
each byte. The "string" "SCE-1783 for_CS" always starts at 0x000000D0 
and ends always at 0x000000DE.<br>
The next block with the value 0x00 for each byte starts at 0x000000DF to 0x0000014F. Then follows the rest of the data.</div></div><hr>

<br>
We can't know for sure if they restore idstorage keys or not using the 
jigkick unless we get ourselves a decrypted version of the MS files, 
which we don't and given the likely copyrighted nature of the content 
we'd better delete the files especially since encrypted those wont bring
 us anything good and that it would be illegal to have these anyway. In 
fact speaking of anything copyrighted should be off limits unless you 
want SCE to shut down these forums.<br>
<br>
In my belief, whatever way used to setup idstorage keys at factory is 
probably gone (destroyed at factory) and probably sony themselves cannot
 restore the said keys. (I came to that conclusion as sony do not even 
dare touch to idstorage keys in their updaters (to prevent downgraders 
or custom firmwares) probably in the fear of damaging those.)<br>
<br>
Finally the best would be to concentrate on things such as the lepton 
(UMD) hardware which probably has a mean to access spock. (since it 
checks for the idstorage keys by itself) I wouldn't be surprised if 
there is a microcode inside the UMD drive (a firmware or such) and a way
 to dump it. We may also interact with the hardware itself and try to 
access spock by bruteforcing the calls the UMD drive uses.</div></div><hr>

I do not think it is illegal to have them, however I think it is illegal
 if anyone might use them. Even the DMCA allows for reverse engineering.
 Even the European Laws allow it. We are allowed to speak over them as 
we all have our freedom of speech. but we can not hosts those files 
here. That will surely allow Sony to close this board.<br>
<br>
The ID Storage keys maybe discarded at the factory but Sony can restore 
them. They can make them again by doing the same process again. The 
updaters never have to do anything with the ID Storage than to query. 
Sony does that part right. If there is a error within the ID Storage or 
some keys, then it should display an error message to contact Sony or 
Vendor.<br>
<br>
However their memstick might be able to repair the ID Storage or might 
not be able to fix it. Until we have looked in those files, we can never
 be sure of it.</div></div><hr>

 is illegal to have the files, as they remain full property of Sony, 
when you buy a PSP, you buy an license for the firmwares too, allowing 
you to legally own/use (with lots of limitations, of course).<br>
However, Sony never gave anyone permission (through a license, or any 
different way) to use/own the JigKick files, meaning it remains property
 of Sony.<br>
If they all talk about the files here on the forums, they have their 
proofs everyone who is talking about them (illegally) owns them, so 
you're basically getting yourself in problems. But that's just my 
theory, can't be really sure, I'm not an lawyer :p</div></div><hr>

Well, there is the simplest answer... it is cheaper to scrap a hardware

Well, it remains speculative if they are worth investigating until 
someone does it. It could lead to nothing or to a solution in 
regenerating the ID Storage keys. The different encryption would suggest
 that there is something they are hiding. The files are not that hard to
 get. You just have to know where to look. ;)<br>

Until we know exactly and I mean exactly what they do, it remains 
speculation. And it is not for nothing. We or someone or I found a way 
not to fix the ID Storage keys. The path they suggest could lead to a 
way to fix the ID Storage, but it might not be the only way is what I am
 saying.<br>
<br>
It is not a must to decrypt those files.That is all.</div></div><hr>

As suggested previously, the best available courses of action that could generate results are still:<br>
1) attacking the hardware directly to gain inner workings.<br>
2) attacking the firmware to remove it's reliance on certain unique keys.<br>

good thinkin brin_vg if im understanding you right <br>
you're sayin there may be a few valid keys for every PSP rather than one unique set per PSP<br>
like windows has many valid keys but only one true volume license key<br>
so all youde need is the decryption key and the algorythm that generates the IDStorage keys<br>
well worth investigation<br>
but if the unique keys come back different, that would surely make 
working out the generation of such keys all that much harder, wouldnt 
it?</div></div><hr>

Unfortunately, that is still not proof enough. It is known that Sony do 
motherboard replacements in some repairs. What he should have done is 
scratch the motherboard instead.<br>
<br>
What he got back may simply have been his original case but with a new refurbished motherboard inside.</div></div><hr>

That should not be too hard to realise. Install a special PRX that loads
 at the first firmware boot, creates the IDStorage keys and erases 
itself from flash and btcnf. But if that is the case, it must be 
possible to find traces of that PRX in the untouched flash0 dump of a

As before, the most feasible way I think would be to bypass IDStorage,

I think that sounds like a plausible way that sony makes the idstorage 
keys because some ware i saw that one of the IDStorage keys shows the 
first firmware that was on the psp so when the psp first boots the prx 
must read the firmware version and read some other hardware ino then 
create the IDStorage so there must be a prx that does this then deletes 
its self off of the flash0.<br>

Off topic: You spelt your name wrong :( GameBpx :D<br>
<br>
The method of generating IDStorage (or at least, the keys generated, 
obviously) changed with the hardware, which would suggest a hardware 
method. But as retrieving lost info on lflash is supposedly impossible, 
there's no clear way to tell.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Random pondering:<br>
<br>
Key 52 - Suspected to contain manufacturing info, which would mean either:<br>
     - Each factory/production line/etc has a unique chip used in IDStorage generation<br>
     - There is some kind of production stage input into IDStorage.<br>
<br>
Key 54 - May well be used for unlocking/special features, i.e. The Simpsons game on a Simpsons edition PSP.<br>

It's be interesting to know if one of the hardware gurus would be able 
to obtain a hardware-method flash dump of a PSP that has never been 
turned on since it left the factory, then compare it to a dump after the
 same PSP has been booted.<br>
<br>
If part of the production line powers on (00000000) the PSP and does the magic there, IDStorage will already be in place.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathieulh</div><div class="date">01-11-2008, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">btw
 in case anyone is interested, in slim nands (factory flashed ones 
without any modifications like M33 installed or 3.70+ installed) you can
 see the reminants of some IPL blocks that have not been erased by 0xFF 
(there is about 25kBytes of remaining IPL blocks) and that was probably 
preflashed on the nand and used at factory to setup the psps. The fact 
that there are still traces of it suggest the IPL itself to have been 
huge. Unfortunately we have not enough blocks to ever hope for a 
decryption. <br>
<br>
It is likely that this IPL starts a specific kernel on the psp that 
setups the psp (inclueding idstorage) then destroy the possibility to 
ever generate idstorage keys again and overwrites itself with 3.60 
kernel.<br>
<br>
I tried to locate traces of simuilar IPLs on a fresh 1.00 dump but all I
 could see was 0xFF so either sony did not use the nands to setup 
original psps from factory, either they did a better job at occulting 
the factory IPL than they did on slim (I believe in that second option) 
it also explains the 0x00000000 serial used in the batteries that auto 
poweron the psps and yet still runs the IPL from the nands.</div></div><hr>

 interesting. Sounds about right that they produce all the batteries

So Sony is able to do the same again when a PSP is bricked. They can 
flash the same "firmware" again. Too bad that the leaked jigkick memory 
sticks aren't decrypted yet.</div></div><hr>

 belief is that the factory kernel (I will call it that way) writes the 
kirk id into the syscon chip, the kirk id would be a One Time

keys using the kirk id previously stored in ram. I expect the kirk id to
 be a random number. This means that even sony could not regenerate 
idstorage keys for the kirk id would be lost at power off. (and of 
course there would be no way of getting it but hardware probing) Also 
this means that even in the unlikely event that we ever get this factory

<br>
Well I had a look from a 3.60 dump. The only remains of the factory IPL 
is the last 6 blocks of it. The blocks themselves decrypt fine but 
unfortunately, being the last 6 blocks of an IPL they end up landing 
right at the end of the payload, which of course (being the bastards 
they are) are encrypted again. Without having the full copy, wont be 
possible to extract any sort of plaintext out of it.<br>
<br>
Interestingly though, it's quite a massive IPL (roughly 240KB 
decrypted), and entry point is still 0x040F0000 just like the retail 
IPL's.<br>
<br>
Should also point out that service center flashing (ie. via jigkick) may
 not necessarily be the same as factory flashing. They might be similar 
in methods, but does not necessarily mean that either of them can full 
restore idstorage. My guess is that it may be possible, if taken back to
 factory. Though I doubt they would waste money doing that. Most of the 
time it would be cheaper just to provide a refurbished model instead.<br>
<br>
Also yes, key0x54 is just the setting for default XMB background colour.
 All default settings are stored in idstorage. This is so they can 
change them for different region models, eg. your default 
time/city/language etc. for the different models. You can play around 
with key0x54 by changing values and "Restoring Default Settings" to have
 a look. Utterly useless, but fun nonetheless (oh and thanks to cory for
 actually rebooting so many times to test the different values on his 
own psp :P).</div></div><hr>

Assume... nuff said (good theory and I'm willing to believe it but I 
don't see any way to test it beside contracting some ninja or 
something...) Having the last few blocks simply isn't enough to tell how
 big it was to begin with, perhaps they did it on purpose or made an SCE
 at the last second and this so called factory IPL starts 0x10 blocks 
farther in than it usually does. Index dependent and all; nothing says 
it has to start at the beginning of the available space. Maybe they even
 left it/did it to taunt, knowing before hand exactly how compromised 
their units are already :D<br>
<br>
It does make a lot of sense though, the chips can come pre-flashed and 
QA'd with a standard firmware from factory - also somewhat explains the 
lag between current firmware and installed firmware on a new unit. I 
guess keep an eye out for an out of the box brick that can still run 
pandora though, you never know... a "factory stick" may be a part of 
that initial setup process.<br>
<br>
(oh and thanks to cory for actually rebooting so many times to test the different values on his own psp :P)<br>
Quite welcome. If I ever get the time I'd set up my own idstore to my 
liking, though I think I have reset the PSP I use a total of... 1 time, 
IIRC.</div></div><hr>

Sure it does :D. In fact you really only need the final block of the IPL
 to determine the decrypted size, since it gives you the entry address 
and also the address and size of where the final block is to be loaded. <br>
<br>
The last 6 decrypted IPL blocks of the Factory IPL.<br>
<br>
loadaddr	blocksize	entry		checksum<br>
0x04125980	0xF50		0		0x729D1DC0<br>
0x041268D0	0xF50		0		0x39C3A1D7<br>
0x04127820	0xF50		0		0x572B030C<br>
0x04128770	0xF50		0		0x7B8E52F8<br>
0x041296C0	0xF50		0		0x0462AFB0<br>
0x0412A610	0x210		0x040F0000	0x331B9575<br>
<br>
So the whole decrypted Factory IPL is loaded from 0x040F0000 - 0x0412A820, which equals 0x3A820 Bytes (239,648 Bytes)</div></div><hr>

Probably won't work, but you should get the idea. Since the data is not 
known... you just don't know. Though I still agree, mainly as I doubt 
they'd flash something at factory that contains NULL'd blocks unless it 
is to specifically test their idea of the biggest IPL block they may 
ever use on the unit as some form of demented QA.<br>

I didn't ever think I'd have to explain all that too though, especially after some reading... <br>

So, byte 0x8 is 0x8 in the FAT and 0x14 in the SLIM, and the rest after 
0xC looks pretty random. Looks like theres some pattern in there but 
can't work out what it represents.</div></div><hr>

If someone could look at key 0x0007 of a TA-08X which hasn't been

what triggers the key to be generated, if at all, perhaps?</div></div><hr>

 brin_vg, I've added the case colours that I could get hold of to the 
list, along with your key and one from another Slim :)<br>
<br>
cory1492, that list isn't entirely accurate. I've just checked a few 
that I didn't think looked right and came to conclusion that key 4 and 
key 6 are always the same in Fat TA-079~TA-086, slightly different in 
the Slim and they added more stuff, but still the same in all Slims.<br>
However I didn't realise that key 12 was actually the same in ALL PSPs, so thanks :)<br>
<br>
edit: Key 4-8 mystery solved :p The data only starts at 0x10, the stuff 
earlier is a hash, so whenever the data is changed the hash is updated. 
In the Slim, they only just started using the data rather than leaving 
it blank, so the datalength and hashes changed. Added key 4-8 struct to 
first post, thanks for the explanation SilverSpring.</div></div><hr>

Are the duplicates even used? As in, checking main key vs duplicate?<br>
<br>
That information was given to me by l_oliveira, apparently those keys 
have duplicates at their original location + 0x8000, separately from 
0x120-0x126 which are read at the same time as 0x100-0x106 respectively,
 in case there's a random error on the 0x100X ones - just shows how 
valuable those keys are.<br>
<br>
But no the keys are never used to compare against their original, it's just a backup thing.<br>
<br>
Also, cory, I have a bunch of key dumps where 0x006 was just a copy of 
0x005 and all sorts of other messed up combinations, a la original 
TA-082 downgrader and Noobz TA-082 downgrader. This may have affected 
your results.<br>
<br>
Does key 07 have to be there? what problems occur if it isn't found, because it's not in any of the pre 86 models.<br>
<br>
Looks like it isnt being used at the moment, and whatever it's doing doesn't apply to older hardware.</div></div><hr>

Seems a bit of a useless backup, since if the main keys go, odds are so

It would've made much more sense (and would be rather useful) to create a backup set in flash3/4/5 in the factory.<br>

 is possible to restore a slim that has had it's keys lost to a state 
where most functions under custom firmware will work, but the stuff that
 relies on unique/per-psp keys (ie: UMD reading) is not going to work. 
Because of the way idstore is crypted on slims, those who have lost 
their idstore entirely (sometimes by overwriting with another slims's 
nand dump, sometimes by using idstore manager from pandora - which will 
try to put the keys in unencrypted) it becomes nearly impossible to run 
homebrew on the slim even from cfw. I added a method to reinstate 
idstore even on slim to nandTool when it's loaded from des.cem V3 base 
which will crypt the keys back in those cases and the above was the 
results of my pre-release testing.<br>
-------<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in looking at the raw dumped contents of the 
decrypted NAND area of slim's idstore, see attachment for the dumper. It
 only dumps the 16 blocks relevant to idstore, it interleaves the spare 
data after each page, and I have only ever run it from an elf menu under
 des cem V3 - though it would probably work under custom firmware if the
 appropriate nids are mapped out. A most notable oddity is that 
blocks/pages that are normally 0xFF on a fat seem to be something else 
entirely when decrypted on a slim and are not 0xFF in a raw NAND dump. 
Also, before anyone asks it's not necessary to decrypt idstore on 
non-slim models (you can extract keys from a fat using various scripts 
and tools out there already.)</div></div><hr>

It's shows up as an American PSP-1001 because that's what your Phat is. 
IDSM/KeyCleaner reads the key, and if one byte is (can't remember, lol)

jas0nuk, maybe at a very secure server within the Sony network?<br>
I have been wondering about that, because libdnas_core.prx has url 
pspdnas-ld02.rd.scei.sony.co.jp hardcoded. I tried to resolve that in

Just to clarify, I meant flashing someone else's NAND dump. Obviously flashing your own PSPs NAND dump wouldn't matter xD<br>

I did dump my friends slim idstorage keys and wrote them to my f****d slim.<br>
<br>
Now running idstoragemanager it show my motherboard as being a TA-085 and my region as an American PSP-2001.<br>
<br>
Flashed CFW 3.71 M33-2 with pandora and voil, almost fully working PSP (UMD didn't work) but played ISO's and homebrew.<br>
<br>
Tried to flash 3.80 m33 UPDATE and it formated my flash2 and bricked it again.<br>
<br>
Back to square1 so, opened nandtool v0.3beta1 and wrote nand full image,
 then wrote my friends keys again, flashed 3.71M33-2 and formated flash1<br>
got the BSOD removed battery. Plugged battery back and started PSP and it's working again (except UMD).<br>
<br>
So I guess that it's possible to write idstorage keys from one slim to another. The only thing missing is UMD functions.</div></div><hr>

each one of those 'blocks' maps to exactly one Nand Block. As you see 
the third block is not indexed at all, but the actual contents of that 
nandblock is just backup of the fourth block. It's a bit unusual yes, 
but that's sce.<br>
<br>
Yes the LICENSE folder is for psn certificates, they've removed it now but along with the 'Certificate Utility' icon in XMB.<br>
<br>
Also I seriously doubt sce would store copies of the idstorage on a 
server anywhere, a single factory produces over 30,000 psp's per day. Im
 sure they wouldnt store copies of each ones idstorage.</div></div><hr>

 It now shows as TA-085 PSP-2001 because that data was in the keys of 
the Slim you took the dump from. It hasn't regenerated your key, they 
just happen to be the same (as with many keys that are now restored on 
it). UMD functions don't work because the keys for UMD decryption are 
PSP specific, you have another PSPs keys, so they won't decrypt on 
your's.<br>

<br>
DNAS on psp is just like DNAS on ps2, a way to remotely verify and 
authenticate the user. It's used whenever the psp needs to be 
authenticated online, for example when enabling WMA or Flash in 
settings, or updating the time online in settings. Or for infrastructure
 mode games.<br>
<br>
The encryption for it is relatively complex (multiple sigcheck cmds 
encrypted with the hw prng used as a nonce to make sure all 
transmissions are never encrypted the same twice). But it does check 
key0x100 for authentication of the psp (sceMcctrl is the lib responsible
 for the encryption).<br>
<br>
And some new DNAS nids that havent been added onto the prxdocs site yet for anyone that's interested:<br>
0x45c1aaf5 sceDNASGetEventFlag<br>
0x2370130e sceDNASCoreCheckProxyResponse<br>
0xda5939b4 sceDNASCoreGetProxyRequest<br>
0xc54657b7 sceDNASCoreSetProxyResponse<br>
0x26e1e2bd sceDNASCoreSetChallenge<br>
0xb6c76a14 sceDNASCoreCheckChallenge<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
About the nids, we've been thinking of setting up a LAN.st project for 
people to help out. Currently, there are around roughly 3-4 people in 
the entire world (that I know of :p) that are actively searching for new
 nids. Basically how it'll work, app's will be posted up (bruteforce 
crackers essentially), and users download them and run them on the PC 
(for however long they are willing to). Details will come soon...(I hope
 :p). And if there's enough interest, it might be expanded. Perhaps a 
distributed cracker even.</div></div><hr>

Er, no. The function 'name' refers to the function's NID.<br>

I think you mean in this sort of case:<br>
NID - Function Name<br>
0x4C268535 - sceSemawm_4C268535<br>
<br>
I'm meaning more like:<br>
NID - Function Name<br>
0x586DB82C - sceUsbActivate <br>
<br>
That's why (before the 3.80 NID resolver) programs compiled with an old 
NID map wouldn't work on newer firmwares, as the function names were the
 same, but the NIDs were different to how the program was compiled.</div></div><hr>

 just casually speaking, I usually use "nid" interchangeably to mean 
either the 32bit hash or the function name that belongs to that hash.<br>
<br>
Technically though, an "nid" is a Name Identifier (SCE's terminology). 
That is, a value that is used to identify a name. It is a 32bit hex 
value that is taken from the first 32bits of the SHA1 hash of a name (in
 little endian format).<br>
<br>
Example: for the name "HelloWorld", <br>
<br>
the SHA1 hash is:<br>
db 8a c1 c2 59 eb 89 d4 a1 31 b2 53 ba cf ca 5f 31 9d 54 f2<br>
<br>
the first 32bits is:<br>
db 8a c1 c2<br>
<br>
and in little endian, makes:<br>
0xc2c18adb<br>
<br>
So 0xc2c18adb is then the Name Identifier for the name "HelloWorld".<br>
<br>
SCE uses these nids to identify the imports/exports of a module. We do 
not know the original names of these functions. However, since we know 
the hash of the name of the function (the nids) we can run a dictionary 
brute force attack on the nids to crack the original names.<br>
<br>
Though there's a bit more skill to actually crack them. Firstly, you 
need to correctly guess the prefix; secondly, you need to be able to 
differentiate real hits from false positives (since the nid is only 
using 32bits of the hash, you will get a LOT of false positives); and 
thirdly, you need to be able to carefully choose a good dictionary 
(again because of false positives). It also helps to target individual 
functions, knowing what the function does helps in guessing its name and
 hence building a good dictionary for it.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
From 3.70+ SCE started randomising the nids (well actually not strictly 
true, they also did so for a few select functions in previous firmwares,
 typically the ones they were trying to protect like some of the crypto 
ones as well as dve+hibari once they were cracked and the slim hadnt 
been publically announced yet). The nid is no longer the SHA1 hash of 
the original function name, now the nid is a just a random 32bit value 
assigned to the function. They were randomised again in 3.80 too (and 
probably will be again in the next firmware update). So these new nids 
cant be cracked anymore, new functions and new libs will remain unknown 
(probably forever :(). It also makes it that little bit much harder to 
disassemble modules.</div></div><hr>

 when I decompile with IDA, I see words like SceUtilityModule. 
SceUtilityAppletWorktime, SceUtilityAppletPartition, 
SceUtilityAppletInit and SceUtilityAppletShutdown in 3.80 Utility.prx. I
 do not see them in the published library. I do not know if you have 
found them too.<br>

 those names are not the function names but just enum names or lib names

On another note, here is an IdStorage checksum list from a new type Slim
 PSP (baryon number 0x00234000) which cannot write the battery serial 
number (fails with a Syscon error code, evidently they changed the 
Syscon firmware to make it error out when the battery NVM is tried to be

bf619eac0cdf3f68d496ea9344137e8b refers to an empty key.<br>
<br>
The only static key they changed was key 8. A single byte was changed, 
this affected the checksum of the data section (see the struct in the 
first post). Nothing else important changed.<br>
<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilverSpring</div><div class="date">01-19-2008, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jachra: if you find these strings in the plaintext, theres a 99% chance they are not nids.<br>
<br>
A little hint: sce NEVER use uppercase for the first letter in function 
names. They will use uppercase first letter for things like typedefs, 
enums, resource names, etc. But never for function names.<br>
<br>
Those strings you found are (usually) names assigned to semaphores, 
event flags, memory pools, callbacks, pretty much any type of resource 
since you have to specify a name when creating them.<br>
<br>
In the past, if you were lucky (especially in early firmwares like 1.00 
or 1.50), you might have debug build modules that had asserts/kprintfs 
left in which exposed the function name in plaintext. But sce has learnt
 a long time ago to stop doing that. And even then, you were lucky to 
get only a handful of nids for free.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
Also, it would be pretty sloppy of me (and others that were helping out)
 to have missed nids in plaintext. For a new module, the strings inside 
are usually the first to be checked (to see if sce are stupid enough to 
leave them in). Though, there is a very slim chance that you'll find a 
new nid in some modules, if I (and others) had missed it previously 
(especially in modules that we do not care much for and hence have not 
had a proper look at).</div></div><hr>

 those names are not the function names but just enum names or lib names
 or something like that. Sony don't leave any function names in 
plaintext any more.<br>
<br>
On another note, here is an IdStorage checksum list from a new type Slim
 PSP (baryon number 0x00234000) which cannot write the battery serial 
number (fails with a Syscon error code, evidently they changed the 
Syscon firmware to make it error out when the battery NVM is tried to be
 written to)<br>

<br>
The only static key they changed was key 8. A single byte was changed, 
this affected the checksum of the data section (see the struct in the 
first post). Nothing else important changed.<br>
<br>
edit: Did a tidyup to the first post again.<br>
<br>
hum... looks like they started changing syscon then, still the fact that
 you can provide us with the idstorage dump hashes of this psp fairly 
means that they the pandora still works (meaning that they still use the
 0xFFFFFFFF serial batteries to trigger the service mode and that our 
forged block works just as well as it did on earlier models. This 
obviously means that they did not (or rather could not) change the cpu 
mask rom codes (they probably have a few thousands to use) The day they 
need a new batch of cpu is the day pandora stops working. (I hope not 
before the 03g model)</div></div><hr>

 those names are not the function names but just enum names or lib names
 or something like that. Sony don't leave any function names in 
plaintext any more.<br>
<br>
On another note, here is an IdStorage checksum list from a new type Slim
 PSP (baryon number 0x00234000) which cannot write the battery serial 
number (fails with a Syscon error code, evidently they changed the 
Syscon firmware to make it error out when the battery NVM is tried to be
 written to)<br>

<br>
The only static key they changed was key 8. A single byte was changed, 
this affected the checksum of the data section (see the struct in the 
first post). Nothing else important changed.<br>
<br>
edit: Did a tidyup to the first post again.<br>
<br>
hum... looks like they started changing syscon then, still the fact that
 you can provide us with the idstorage dump hashes of this psp fairly 
means that they the pandora still works (meaning that they still use the
 0xFFFFFFFF serial batteries to trigger the service mode and that our 
forged block works just as well as it did on earlier models. This 
obviously means that they did not (or rather could not) change the cpu 
mask rom codes (they probably have a few thousands to use) The day they 
need a new batch of cpu is the day pandora stops working. (I hope not 
before the 03g model)<br>
<br>
<br>
Pandora bat and stick work indeed!. (its mine psp), but the bat serial writing<br>
can't be executed. So i use a pandorized bat. (made on another slim) to play with.<br>
I was only triggered on this new behaveiour because with 3.80M33 you guys<br>
fixed this +/- 1,5 week ago (the bat serial writing). And i bought a new
 slim and it coudn't do the trick with the updated softwares 
(cory1492-hellcat). <br>
So i did release the nand-dump to 2 guys (or girls? :) ). <br>
And your looking at it. <br>
Iam reading along this thread to see were it will stop or have succes.<br>
<br>
I find it interresting because as a old TP/delphi programmer in the old days, <br>
I loved to do reverse enginering. Stopped rev. eng. for many years now.. moved on...<br>
New improvements (cat and dog game) stopped mine learning curve and interrest.<br>
<br>
Sorry that this is become a personal reply but now you know why i'm <br>
calling out the new findings.<br>

PS: If i can help with some tricks, just pm. (except opening the psp and scrathing the mobo with a slegdehamer... :)  )</div></div><hr>

What tools do I need, to find those nids?<br>

Well for a start, you could use the nidattack in the pspsdk svn:<br>

Thank you. I will compile that and start with it. Compiled it, do you have some input examples?<br>
<br>

<br>
Do you want more key 0x07 values for comparison?</div></div><hr>

 to sound a little @#$%^ but what about the main topic? How R U guys 
doing with the ID Storage fixing thing? Dont mean to sound pushy, but it
 was really interesting when U guys were talking about how it works.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghostman</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys<br>
<br>
Don't if this has anything to do with IdStorage but I think it might.<br>
<br>
I had a full bricked slim with no nand backup so I had nothing to lose 
by experimenting. So I got someone elses idstorage keys and flashed the 
nand and wrote those keys to it (since I had corrupt idstorage keys 
anyway i didn't care) flashed 3.71m33-2 and it would boot but would stop
 at the waves background and no icons. So i started experimenting on 
recovery and formated flash1. Still nothing. So I went and disabled Sony
 Logo on start up and voil it booted. It doesn't read homebrew or games
 (it starts them but then freezes on the sony logo). If turn Sony Logo 
on startup I won't get past the waves and if I turn it off it boots 
normally but freezes on the sony logo when starting a game or homebrew.<br>
<br>
So what happens during the Sony Logo on startup that makes it not boot?<br>
<br>
It might be that it reads some of the keys on idstorage?<br>
<br>
Just wanted to share this. Don't know if anyone tried this or not but here goes anyway.<br>
<br>
Cheers.</div></div><hr>

 The topic was intended to work out how to regenerate it, but it appears
 we've hit a dead end until 1) a jigkick is leaked and it gets decrypted

Don't expect anything to happen within the next month or two... or six.<br>

it reads a region related key which crashes the logo but doesn't get

And in the meantime, we are filling in the blanks on parts of IDStorage that have just been introduced, or aren't understood.</div></div><hr>
